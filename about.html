		<h3>What is this?</h3>
		<p>Queer sins calendar! Various people have joked about the idea of having seven queer months for each of the Seven Deadly Sins, so I decided to one-up them by making a seven-month calendar. Turns out, 365 divides pretty well into sevens. I hope for it to be adopted as the global standard calendar after the queer aristocracy violently seizes power.</p>
		<h3>What do the day names signify?</h3>
		<p>The days are named after the Greek goddess Nyx, situated in the centre, and her twelve daughters (or groups of daughters). In order, they are situated: Oizys	Achlys,	Apate,	Nemesis,	Hybris,	Hesperides,	Nyx,	Keres	Moirai,	Eris,	Philotes,	Elpis, and Eleos. Each goddess personifies a concept, which could be seen as granting that meaning to her day.</p>
		<h3>What do the other terms mean?</h3>
		<p>The year format, YPA, refers to Years Post-Asymptote. The asymptote in question is roughly the one approached in <a href="https://genius.com/Nick-land-meltdown-annotated">Meltdown</a> in the sequence 1500, 1756, etc. Queerness lies in Outsideness. The week names—slime, mold, smog, blight—honestly don't have a lot of thought behind them; they exist mostly as a way to refer to days in a month without a numeric date. The site title is in reference to that time the Pope said trans people were defacing god, which is an accidentally great aesthetic.</p>
		<h3>What do the holidays mean?</h3>
		<p>The holidays are mostly either explicit references to queer mythology or veiled references to other queer happenings on the same day. If anyone wants to contribute to add to these, they can feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/lilypatchwork">Twitter</a>. Holidays in the special week do not have a day or a week: these are Nexus Day (the leap day) and Halloween (New Year's Eve). Why Halloween? It's gay Christmas and also the only good holiday.</p>
		<h3>This site has some problems.</h3>
		<p>It certainly does. Because I, someone who does not really know web design, made this from scratch, the HTML/CSS/JS is Voynich Manuscript levels of incomprehensible and black hole levels of spaghettified. You can DM me on Twitter if you find specific issues to fix.</p>
		<h3>I want to use or contribute to this site.</h3>
		<p>If you want to use any part of this website, go ahead; no reservations. Again, though, my HTML/CSS/JS are an absolute clusterfuck and you might not want to deal with them. If you want to contribute something or want help acquiring / decoding a component of this project, DM me on Twitter.</p>
